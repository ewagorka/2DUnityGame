# 2DUnityGame
As a part of my Computer Games module, I have created a simple 2D platformer game inspired by the video game ‘Braid
’ by Number None development studio. The main inspiration was the time mechanic utilised in 'Braid'.
The game is entirely made using Unity and it's 2D rendering and physics system. All object behaviours in the game I
wrote in C#. For the graphics and artwork, I used "Sunny Land" assets kit from the Unity Asset Store. The player can move the character left/right,
jump and climb ladders, all with simulated gravity and separate animations for each activity. My game offers the user three levels to choose from,
in each, there are some obstacles to avoid. Upon contact, the character will die. In each level, the player can rewind time up to 20 seconds backwards
in a single rewind action. After rewinding the player will continue playing from the moment they either stopped rewinding or from the point where player
ran out of rewind time (the moment when the timer shows 0).

In this repository I have included my C# scripts.
